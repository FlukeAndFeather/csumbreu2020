# csumbreu2020
Teaching materials for the "Introduction to Coding for Emerging Geoscientists Workshop".

## Get started

1. Go to https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/csumbreu2020
2. Download code archive (Code > Download ZIP)
3. Unzip csumbreu2020-master.zip
4. Open csumbreu2020.Rproj in RStudio
5. Open MAKE.R and source the file (Mac: Cmd+Shift+S, Windows: Ctrl+Shift+S)
6. While that runs, answer the following questions using the Arctic marine mammal phylogenetic tree (arctic_marmam_tr.png). [in breakout rooms]
  1. What are the common names of each species?
  2. What does the x-axis represent? What do you think its units are?
  3. When was the last common ancestor of:  
    Bowhead and minke whales?  
    Bowhead and beluga whales?  
    Bowhead whales and harp seals?  
  4. What is the alpha diversity of a community with:  
    Bowheads, minkes, and harp seals?  
    Bearded, harp, and ringed seals?  
  5. What is the unit of measurement for Faithâ€™s phylogenetic diversity (PD) metric?
  6. What is the PD of a community with:   
    Bowheads, minkes, and harp seals?  
    Bearded, harp, and ringed seals?  
  7. If I have a community with bowhead and beluga whales:  
    How much does alpha diversity change by adding minkes?  
    How much does alpha diversity change by adding bearded seals?  
    How much does PD change by adding minkes?  
    How much does PD change by adding bearded seals?
