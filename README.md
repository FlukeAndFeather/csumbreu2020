# csumbreu2020
Teaching materials for the "Introduction to Coding for Emerging Geoscientists Workshop".

## Get started

1. Go to https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/csumbreu2020
2. Download code archive (Code > Download ZIP)
3. Unzip csumbreu2020-master.zip
4. Open csumbreu2020.Rproj in RStudio
5. Open MAKE.R and source the file (Mac: Cmd+Shift+S, Windows: Ctrl+Shift+S)
6. While that runs, answer the following questions using the Arctic marine mammal phylogenetic tree (arctic_marmam_tr.png). [in breakout rooms]
  
  Q1. What are the common names of each species in the tree?  
  Q2. What does the x-axis represent? What are its units?  
  Q3. When was the last common ancestor of:  
    * Bowhead and minke whales?  
    * Bowhead and beluga whales?  
    * Bowhead whales and harp seals?  
  Q4. What is the alpha diversity of a community with:  
    * Bowheads, minkes, and harp seals?  
    * Bearded, harp, and ringed seals?  
  Q5. What is the unit of measurement for Faithâ€™s phylogenetic diversity (PD) metric?  
  Q6. What is the PD of a community with:   
    * Bowheads, minkes, and harp seals?  
    * Bearded, harp, and ringed seals?  
  Q7. If I have a community with bowhead and beluga whales:  
    * How much does alpha diversity change by adding minkes?  
    * How much does alpha diversity change by adding bearded seals?  
    * How much does PD change by adding minkes?  
    * How much does PD change by adding bearded seals?
